- IMDb - IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos and video games, and internet streams, including cast, production crew and personnel biographies, plot summaries, trivia, and fan reviews and ratings.

- Sentiment Analysis is a popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) task which allows us to extract the overall opinion in a text. In this project, I will be performing Sentiment Analysis on some IMDB movie reviews, to classify the overall review as positive or negative.


## Dataset

The labeled training data set consists of 25,000 IMDB movie reviews. There is also an unlabeled test set with 25,000 IMDB movie reviews. The sentiment of the reviews are binary, meaning an IMDB rating < 5 results in a sentiment score of 0, and a rating >=7 have a sentiment score of 1 (no reviews with score 5 or 6 are included in the analysis). No individual movie has more than 30 reviews.


### Data columns
